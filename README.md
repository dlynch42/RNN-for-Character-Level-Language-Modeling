# RNN for Character-Level Language Modeling
 
Built an RNN model with the input as a text document. Goal is to generate new text similar to the input document. I processed data by creating a dataset to represent unique characters, made a dictionary to map each character to an integer, and another dictionary that performed reverse mapping. I converted text to a NumPy array of integers. Then reshaped into batches of sequences and created a batch_generator function. Built a CharRNN class with a build method that used one-hot encoding instead of embedding layer, a train method, and sample method (similar to predict method in Sentiment Analysis RNN). I called a CharRNN instance to train the data, then sampled and returned a text document. The original data is in old English which makes the text a little more interesting.
